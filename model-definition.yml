  description: >
    SHETRAN is a model for water flow, solute and sediment transport in river catchments.
    SHETRAN is a finite-difference model in which the physics-based governing partial differential equations for flow and transport are solved on a three-dimensional grid.
    SHETRAN is a physically-based, spatially-distributed (PBSD) modelling system.
    The plan area of the catchment in SHETRAN is usually in the range of one to a few thousand square kilometers and the horizontal depth of the subsurface is usually less than 100m.
    This DAFNI model runs the Linux version of SHETRAN Prepare (Snow) and SHETRAN using a library file and preprocessed input data.

          SHETRAN output files.
          All input datasets are included in along with the output files.
          Input files generated by SHETRAN Prepare are prepended with "input_".
          Outputs are prepended with "output_".
          The majority of results are contained in the HDF file, which has the extension `.h5`.
          Discharge at the outlet is available in text format at either regular timesteps or every model time step.
